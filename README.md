# Checkpoint 2 — Feature Branch, Pull Request & Review

## Goal

Show that you can complete the core Git collaboration workflow without developing directly on `main`.

```text
clone
→ create feature branch
→ edit
→ git status
→ git add
→ git commit
→ git push
→ open Pull Request
→ review
```

CP2 focuses on the feature-branch → Pull Request → review lifecycle. CP3 adds Issues and Project/Kanban tracking.

## Start the exercise

[![Copy Exercise](https://img.shields.io/badge/COPY%20EXERCISE-%E2%86%92-1f883d?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&labelColor=197935)](https://github.com/new?template_owner=KLIS-CS&template_name=GitHub-Feature-Branch-Pull-Request-Workflow&owner=%40me&name=cp2-feature-branch-pr-workflow&description=Checkpoint+2:+Feature+Branch+%26+Pull+Request+Workflow&visibility=public)

Keep the copied repository **Public** so the mother repository can inspect the evidence.

After the copy is created:

1. Wait for the **Exercise Issue** to appear automatically.
2. Open that Issue and note your exact required branch.
3. Clone the repository locally.
4. Complete the work on the required CP2 branch.
5. Open a Pull Request and get it reviewed.

You do **not** need to open **Actions** or manually run a workflow.

## Required branch

```text
cp2-YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME
```

Example: `cp2-octocat`.

The Pull Request must use this branch as the **head/source branch** and `main` as the **base/target branch**.

## Challenge

On your required CP2 branch:

1. Replace the starter line in `feature.txt` with a short feature description.
2. Complete `submission.md`.
3. Use `git status` before and after staging.
4. Stage the intended files with `git add`.
5. Commit with a meaningful message.
6. Push the CP2 branch to `origin`.
7. Open a Pull Request from `cp2-YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME` → `main`.
8. Request review from another GitHub user.
9. Receive at least one submitted **APPROVED** review.

The Pull Request should change only:

```text
feature.txt
submission.md
```

GitHub detects the Pull Request automatically. Do **not** enter a PR number in `submission.md`.

The grader reads the Pull Request's stored head SHA, so it checks the work on the feature branch rather than the copy on `main`.

## Automatic grading — 60 points

| Evidence | Points |
|---|---:|
| Correct CP2 branch identity | 10 |
| `feature.txt` changed on the PR head | 10 |
| At least one commit belongs to the PR | 5 |
| Pull Request targets `main` | 10 |
| PR changes only `feature.txt` and `submission.md` | 5 |
| `submission.md` is complete on the PR head | 10 |
| Human **APPROVED** review from another GitHub user | 10 |
| **Automatic total** | **60** |

The original **Exercise Issue** is the student-facing status page. Its score comment updates in place.

## Submit for teacher grading

Submit after the PR has received an **APPROVED** review:

[![Submit CP2](https://img.shields.io/badge/SUBMIT%20CP2-%E2%86%92-0969da?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/KLIS-CS/GitHub-Feature-Branch-Pull-Request-Workflow/issues/new?template=cp2-submission.yml)

Repository URL and GitHub username are detected automatically.

Teacher rubric:

- Branch safety — 10
- Git workflow explanation — 10
- Pull Request / review understanding — 10
- Reflection & work quality — 10
